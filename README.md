# DocumentSearcher
this project was to learn how to use Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word;
Word has to be installerd on the computer or it does not work.

previously used nuget manager\docx.. but wanted tor try somthing more fun then just making Document layouts.

so this tiny little program , uses words seperated by a "," to search trough a bunch of documents.
and all the documents that contain the search words are displayed in the second listview.
klicking one of them in that listview will start word and open that document..

it will most likely crash.. it does close after each document and run the collector. so maybe it will not crash.
